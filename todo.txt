- some stuff may be flag dependent
  e.g. should setTitle be available for non-decorated and fullscreen Wins

? sdlexception : runtime_error
? force win/ren functions to be const
? remove RectXY
- add not-graphics sdl features

PixelFmt
  ? better order + layout api

- Win may not live less than Ren
- Ren may not live less than Tex

TexLock
  - make full-texture lock unambigious
  ? get the format mask in a different way
    - SDL_PixelFormatEnumToMasks
